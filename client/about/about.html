				<p>We are freedom lovers, you may feel us Rebels, yes we are.</p>
				<p>A thought about this forum began during the ignition of <a href="teespring.com/kissofaffectionlove" target="_blank">Kiss Of Love</a> event. They are the motivators. If any Moral Police or  one who is currupted happened to see this page, it's sure that, they will burn me raw. But I will say what I should.</p>
				<p>We have only one goal, that is a better world. If this can make a move in the society, or one person among us is ready to share their thoughts (rebellious for Moral Police) we'll be more than happy.</p>
				<p>If you have a social ID in Facebook or Twitter, you are welcome.</p>
				<h4>How do you define my Morality? </h4>
				<p>You can't, its my soul's Identity..<br>

Principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour depends on the one who is doing it. If you are a common man/woman and you don't have any backing from Political or Religious arrays, whatever you do in Public is Immoral.<br>

Moral Police is a group of people whose eyes see only SEX as a relationship between a Male and a Female. First of all they need to come out of the shell they are in now, to see how the world changed and changing. Changes happen from time to time, its universal. <br>

If you think You want to fight against the Morality, do something against Rapists, Corrupted Politicians, Killers and GOD Merchants who are following morality from their head to toe.<br>

Strength of Moral Police is directly proportional to the frustration and regret he /she holds. These frustrations can come from any sources like Missing Love from Parents, Siblings, Friends or even Ex-Lovers. Think once, why you lost it, was that your fault, if not you are a coward. A coward who couldn't feel the real love. Be strong Move On...<br>
